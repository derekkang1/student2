### CSSE WPB Review: Derek Kang
> Review
- In this Web Programming Basics assaignment, I leanrned how to use javascript and html to create stuff on a webpage. I also learned about objects in Javascript and how to manipulate them even after you defined them. You can do this by calling a specific part of the object, then pushing another part of said object, removing part of the object, or editing part of the object. I also learned how to create a button in HTML and how to ocmbine HTML and Javascript together. I learned how to debug ceratain errors by looking at the error provide from the code cell or running it through chatGPT.
